I had to rush to the flughafen because I was going to miss my flight!
I went to the biergarten on St. Patty's day and had green beer.
I needed lots of Brot to soak up the green beer.
So I ran to the nearest baeckerei and said, "Hey! Give me some brot!"
They told me they were out, but they had apfelkuchen.
So, I took the apfelkuchen and went back to my schloss to enjoy it.
On the way there a hund tried to take it so I become wettbewerbsfaehig.
My Hund ended up eating the entire apfelkuchen, so I took the BMW out to get more gaebaecks!
It was so hot outside and my BMW's klimaanlage was not working!
I decided to blast some Ramstein on the radio.
I ended up sticking my head out the window like a hund to try and keep myself cool.

But this didn't work well with my lederhose, so I went to the store and got myself a Dirndel
Leaving the store my BMW broke down. Fortunately a nice lady gave me a ride back to the schloss in her Porsche.
I noticed some onlookers clearly feeling some schadenfreude due to my car problems.
On the way back to the schloss, we were caught in traffic on the Hauptstrasse so we ate all the Gebaecken I purchased.
